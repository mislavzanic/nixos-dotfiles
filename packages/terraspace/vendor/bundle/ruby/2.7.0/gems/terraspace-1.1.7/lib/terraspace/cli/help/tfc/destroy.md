## Example

    $ terraspace tfc destroy demo
    You are about to delete the workspace: demo-dev-us-west-2
    All variables, settings, run history, and state history will be removed.
    This cannot be undone.

    This will NOT remove any infrastructure managed by this workspace.
    If needed, destroy the infrastructure prior to deleting the workspace with:

        terraspace down demo

    This will delete the workspace: demo-dev-us-west-2.
